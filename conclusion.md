In this paper, a novel and highly adaptable framework for optimizing underground gas storage facilities in the presence of forward markets has been proposed. Traditional methodologies, such as least-squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) or dynamic programming, often encounter the so-called curse-of-dimensionality when applied to complex scenarios. However, the introduced frameworks exhibit remarkable resilience to dimensionality challenges, offering a flexible and potent alternative. By leveraging deep learning approaches, the framework demonstrates unprecedented effectiveness in navigating intricate market dynamics while optimizing storage operations. The experimental findings confirm that the proposed deep hedging approach performs as good or better than the state-of-the-art LSMC benchmarks in terms of both runtime efficiency and p&l outcomes.

This research sketches how deep learning methods can effectively address challenging problems where traditional approaches struggle. By successfully applying deep learning for optimizing gas storage plan, the study demonstrates its broader effectiveness in solving complex real-world issues. This highlights the adaptability and strength of deep learning in understanding market dynamics, potentially leading to improved solutions across various domains.
